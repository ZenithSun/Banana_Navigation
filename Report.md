## Learning algorithm

Agents use a policy to decide which actions to take within an environment. The primary objective of the learning algorithm is to find an optimal policyâ€”i.e., a policy that maximizes the reward for the agent. Since the effects of possible actions aren't known in advance, the optimal policy must be discovered by interacting with the environment and recording observations. Therefore, the agent "learns" the policy through a process of trial-and-error that iteratively maps various environment states to the actions that yield the highest reward. This type of algorithm is called Q-Learning.
